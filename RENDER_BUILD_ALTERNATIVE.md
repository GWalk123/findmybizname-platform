# Alternative Render Build Solution

## Issue Analysis
The Vite build process is failing due to import path resolution from the root-level index.html.

## Root Cause
Render's build environment expects index.html at the project root, but Vite is configured with root set to the `client` directory.

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Modify Build Command (Recommended)
Update render.yaml build command to build from the client directory:

```yaml
buildCommand: cd client && npm install --production=false && npx vite build --outDir ../dist/public && cd .. && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

### Option 2: Create Symlink
Create a symlink from root to client/index.html during build process.

### Option 3: Copy Strategy
Copy client/index.html to root during build with corrected paths.

## Current Status
- Frontend working perfectly in development
- Backend API endpoints functional
- Only deployment build failing on import resolution

## Next Steps
Update the build command in render.yaml to properly handle the client directory structure.
