# Vite Build Fix - Import Resolution Error

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "/src/main.tsx" from "/opt/render/project/src/index.html"`

## Root Cause
Vite build process couldn't find the correct path to main.tsx from the client directory structure during production deployment.

## Solution
1. **Created root-level index.html** with correct path: `/client/src/main.tsx`
2. **Added comprehensive SEO metadata** for production deployment
3. **Fixed import path resolution** for Render's build environment

## Files Added
- **index.html** (root level) - Production entry point with SEO optimization
- **VITE_BUILD_FIX.md** - Documentation of the fix

## Expected Result
- Vite build should now complete successfully on Render
- Frontend assets will be properly bundled and served
- SEO metadata will improve search engine indexing

## Upload Instructions
Upload both files to GitHub with commit: "Fix Vite import resolution for production deployment"
